## Setup and Installation

To get the ThunderShopping application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone or Download the Project:**
    If you received a `.zip` file, extract its contents to your desired directory.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to the `website_project` folder:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/website_project
    ```

3.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This isolates the project's dependencies from your system's Python packages.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5.  **Install Dependencies:**
    With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open your web browser and navigate to this address to access the ThunderShopping app.

## Important Notes for Development

-   **`app.secret_key`:** In `app.py`, `app.secret_key` is set to `'your_secret_key'`. For a production environment, you should change this to a strong, randomly generated secret key and keep it confidential.
-   **Session Persistence:** In a development environment, if you restart the Flask server, any items in the shopping cart (which are stored in the session) will be cleared. This is normal behavior for the default Flask development server. For persistent sessions in production, you would integrate with a database or a dedicated session storage solution.
-   **Debugging Cart Issues:** If you encounter problems with the shopping cart, refer to the `CART_DEBUG_GUIDE.md` file in the project directory. It provides detailed explanations of the cart logic and step-by-step debugging instructions.
